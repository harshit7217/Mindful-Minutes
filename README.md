# Mindful-Minutes

<h1>Inspiration</h1>

<p>In today’s busy world, it’s easy to feel mentally drained — especially for students like us who juggle academics, screens, and constant pressure. We noticed how even small moments of peace, like journaling or reading a kind message, helped us feel better. That’s when we thought: <b>Why not create a space that encourages these little mindful moments — with no noise, no login, just peace?</b> And that’s how Mindful Minutes came to life.</p>

<h1> What it does </h1>

<p>Mindful Minutes is a minimalistic mindfulness web app that lets users:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check in with how they’re feeling</li>
    <li>Write a small gratitude note</li>
    <li>CRead a gentle, positive affirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s designed to be fast, distraction-free, and welcoming — ideal for anyone who wants to take a quick mental break.</p>

<h1>How we built it</h1>

<p>We used a simple and clean tech stack.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>HTML</b> for page structure</li>
    <li><b>CSS</b> for styling and layout</li>
    <li><b>JavaScript</b> for interactivity</li>
    <li><b>GitHub</b> for version control</li>
    <li><a href="https://mindfulminutes.netlify.app/"><b>Netlify</b></a> for deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>WE focused on creating a static web experience that feels intentional and claming.</p>
