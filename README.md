# Mindful-Minutes

# Inspiration

<p>In today’s busy world, it’s easy to feel mentally drained — especially for students like us who juggle academics, screens, and constant pressure. We noticed how even small moments of peace, like journaling or reading a kind message, helped us feel better. That’s when we thought: <b>Why not create a space that encourages these little mindful moments — with no noise, no login, just peace?</b> And that’s how Mindful Minutes came to life.</p>
